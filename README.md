## The Origin

**January 21, 2026** — Walking from House of Nanking on Kearny Street to 1 Hotel San Francisco by the Embarcadero, [@fredwilson](https://x.com/fredwilson) challenged [@seth](https://x.com/seth):

> "Well, you can't grow corn."

The argument: AI can write code, but it can't affect the physical world. It can't make things grow.

**This repo is the response.**

## What This Is

This is not a simulation. This is not a metaphor.

We are growing **actual corn** — from seed to harvest — with every management decision made by Claude Code (Opus 4.5). The AI aggregates sensor data, weather forecasts, and satellite imagery to coordinate human operators who execute the physical work.

**The thesis**: AI doesn't need to drive a tractor. It needs to orchestrate the systems and people who do.

## Why "Vibe Coding"?

This project didn't start with a prompt like "generate a farming app."

It started with a conversation between two friends walking through San Francisco at night. The idea emerged from that conversation. Claude Code then collaborated to:

1. **Research** — Iowa farming timelines, custom operator rates, land costs
2. **Architect** — Design the orchestration system
3. **Build** — Decision engine, website, documentation
4. **Deploy** — Domain registered, site live, all in one session

**Vibe coding** is about collaborating with AI to bring ideas into reality — not just generating code from prompts.

*The corn doesn't grow itself. But Claude doesn't touch a single seed either.*

*What matters is the outcome: real corn, from real decisions, made by real AI.*
