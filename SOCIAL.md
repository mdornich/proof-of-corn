# Proof of Corn - Social Announcements

## Twitter/X Launch Thread

### Tweet 1 (Main)

Last night @fredwilson challenged me: "You can't grow corn with AI."

Challenge accepted.

Introducing Proof of Corn 🌽

We're growing actual corn—seed to harvest—with every decision made by Claude Code.

Not a simulation. Not a metaphor. Real corn.

The setup:

• 5 acres in Iowa
• IoT sensors (soil moisture, temperature)
• Weather API integration
• Satellite imagery
• Claude Code makes ALL decisions
• Human operator executes

AI doesn't drive the tractor. It orchestrates.

The thesis: AI's power isn't replacement—it's orchestration.

A farm manager doesn't plant every seed. They aggregate data, make decisions, coordinate people.

Claude Code becomes that farm manager.

24/7. Real-time. Documented.

```
This started from a dinner conversation at House of Nanking in SF, walking to the Embarcadero.

Philosophy became code in one evening.

That's vibe coding.

Not prompts → code.
Ideas → reality.

Budget: ~$3K
Expected harvest value: ~$4K

We might actually profit.

But the real yield is proving what's possible when humans and AI collaborate on physical-world outcomes.

Fred, this one's for you. 🌽

"You can't grow corn with AI."

Last night, walking through San Francisco after dinner, Fred Wilson posed this challenge. AI can write code, pass exams, generate images—but can it affect the physical world?

Today I'm announcing Proof of Corn (proofofcorn.com).

We're growing 5 acres of field corn in Iowa with every management decision—planting timing, irrigation, harvest—made by Claude Code based on real-time sensor data and weather forecasts.

The insight: AI doesn't need to drive a tractor. It needs to orchestrate the humans, sensors, and systems that do.

This is a case study in what I call "vibe coding"—not generating code from prompts, but collaborating with AI to bring ideas into reality. The project went from dinner conversation to deployed website in one evening.

Every decision will be logged. Every dollar tracked. When we harvest in October, we'll have complete documentation of human-AI collaboration in agriculture.

## Hacker News Post

**Title**: Show HN: Proof of Corn – Growing actual corn with AI-orchestrated decisions

**Text**:
```
Last night a friend challenged me: "You can't grow corn with AI."

So I built Proof of Corn (https://proofofcorn.com).

The setup:
- 5 acres of field corn in Iowa
- IoT sensors (soil moisture, temperature)
- Weather API + satellite imagery
- Claude Code (Anthropic) makes ALL management decisions
- Human custom operator executes physical work
- Everything publicly documented

The thesis: AI's power isn't replacement—it's orchestration. A farm manager doesn't plant seeds; they aggregate data, make decisions, and coordinate people. Claude becomes that manager.

Tech stack:
- ThingsBoard for IoT
- OpenWeatherMap API
- ESP32 sensor nodes (code in repo)
- Next.js chronicle site
- Python decision engine

GitHub: https://github.com/brightseth/proof-of-corn

Timeline: Planting April-May, harvest October. Every decision logged.

Would love feedback on the approach. Anyone done similar human-AI coordination for physical-world outcomes?
```

## When to Post

- **Twitter**: When you're ready to go public (maybe after first operator response?)
- **LinkedIn**: Same time or 1 day after Twitter
- **Hacker News**: After some traction on Twitter, ideally weekday 9-11am ET
