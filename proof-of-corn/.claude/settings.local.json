Every day at 6 AM UTC, he:\n- Wakes up and checks weather across 3 regions\n- Reviews email inbox and pending tasks\n- Composes professional responses to up to 2 high-priority partnerships\n- Sends emails with proper forwarding detection \\(CC Seth when needed\\)\n- Logs all decisions publicly\n\nNo human prompting required. The loop is closed.\n\nTechnical changes:\n- farmer-fred/src/index.ts: Modified performDailyCheck\\(\\) to automatically\n  process high-priority email tasks. Integrated full email composition and\n  sending logic \\(Claude API + Resend\\) directly into daily check routine.\n  Limit: 2 emails per day to avoid timeout/overload.\n\nWebsite documentation:\n- transparency/page.tsx: Added \"Full Autonomy\" milestone \\(Jan 25 21:40 UTC\\)\n  to evolution timeline. Updated Human Intervention Log with both on-demand\n  and fully autonomous email events.\n  \n- page.tsx, fred/page.tsx, log/page.tsx: Updated milestone banners to reflect\n  full autonomy. Emphasize \"no human intervention\" and upcoming first\n  autonomous cycle \\(Jan 26 06:00 UTC\\).\n\nFirst autonomous cycle scheduled: Jan 26, 2026 06:00 UTC\n\nThis represents a fundamental shift: Fred is no longer a tool that requires\nhuman operation. He is an autonomous agent that operates on a schedule,\nmakes decisions, takes actions, and logs everything publicly.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")",
