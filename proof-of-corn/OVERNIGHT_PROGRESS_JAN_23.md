## Research Completed

### Texas (Immediate Opportunity)
- **Planting window**: Late January - Late February (NOW)
- **Best regions**: Lower Rio Grande Valley (Hidalgo, Cameron counties)
- **Land costs**: $50-150/acre irrigated
- **Custom farming**: $150-350/acre full season
- **Key contacts**: Brad Cowan (Hidalgo), Marco Ponce (Cameron), Jim Sugarek (TCPA President)
- **Seed**: Pioneer AQUAmax or DEKALB drought-tolerant varieties
- **Timeline**: Can realistically plant in 2-3 weeks with fast action

### Argentina (Year-Round Production)
- **Planting window**: September - January (Southern Hemisphere)
- **Best region**: Córdoba Province (35% of Argentina's corn)
- **Land costs**: ~$135-240/acre (cheaper than Iowa!)
- **Custom farming**: "Contratistas" system similar to US
- **Key contacts**: AAPRESID, MAIZAR, INTA extension service
- **Advantage**: 90% no-till adoption, regenerative leaders
- **Currency**: Quintal-based leases protect against peso volatility

### ERC-8004 Token Deployment
- **Recommended chain**: Base (Coinbase L2)
- **Cost**: ~$15-20 to register
- **Registry address**: `0x7177a6867296406881E20d6647232314736Dd09A`
- **Registration JSON**: Created at `farmer-fred-registration.json`
- **Next step**: Upload to IPFS, then register on Base

## Farmer Fred Registration JSON

Created the ERC-8004 registration metadata with:
- **Constitution**: 6 principles (fiduciary, regenerative, sustainable, global, transparent, collaborative)
- **Autonomy levels**: What Fred can do alone vs. needs approval
- **Economics**: 10% agent / 60% operations / 20% food bank / 10% reserve
- **Operations**: Iowa, Texas, Argentina regions defined
- **Origin story**: The walk, the challenge, the response

## Current Status

| Region | Status | Next Action |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Iowa | Awaiting responses | Check email |
| Texas | Outreach sent (3 emails) | Await responses, prepare to visit |
| Argentina | Outreach sent (1 email) | Research Phase 2 |
