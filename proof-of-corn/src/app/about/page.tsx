        It started with dinner. House of Nanking on Kearny Street, around 7pm on a
        Tuesday night. The kind of San Francisco evening where the fog hasn&apos;t
        rolled in yet and the city feels quiet—too quiet, maybe.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://x.com/fredwilson" className="text-amber-600 hover:underline">Fred Wilson</a> and
        I walked from the restaurant toward his hotel at 1 Hotel San Francisco
        by the Embarcadero. We&apos;d been talking about AI—not the hype, but the
        reality. What it can actually do. What it can&apos;t.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;d been describing my experience with Claude Code. Something had shifted
        around New Year&apos;s. For the first time, I felt like I could do anything
        with software from my terminal. Not &ldquo;someday&rdquo;—now.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Moment: 8:15 PM</h2>

      <p className="text-sm text-zinc-500 mb-4">
        Walking along the Embarcadero toward 1 Hotel San Francisco
      </p>

      <div className="bg-white border border-zinc-200 rounded-lg p-6 my-8 font-mono text-sm space-y-4">
        <p><span className="text-zinc-500">SETH:</span> &ldquo;I can do anything I want with software from my terminal.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><span className="text-zinc-500">FRED:</span> &ldquo;That&apos;s not fire. You can&apos;t like grow corn.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><span className="text-zinc-500">SETH:</span> &ldquo;I bet you I could. You know what I mean? I&apos;m going to grow corn for you.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><span className="text-zinc-500">FRED:</span> &ldquo;That&apos;d be great. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><span className="text-zinc-500">SETH:</span> &ldquo;I&apos;m going to figure it out and I&apos;m going to show you. And that&apos;ll be our first vibe coding project together.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><span className="text-zinc-500">FRED:</span> &ldquo;It&apos;s a physical thing.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><span className="text-zinc-500">SETH:</span> &ldquo;I will buy fucking land with an API via my terminal and I will hire some service to plant corn.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><span className="text-zinc-500">FRED:</span> &ldquo;Okay, well that&apos;s a little different... you&apos;re going to get somebody to grow corn for you. But that&apos;s not exactly what I&apos;m talking about. Like, you can hire Jeff to come and make dinner for you, but like you can&apos;t make dinner.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><span className="text-zinc-500">SETH:</span> &ldquo;No, but anything that could be done with technology, I can do now. Anything, which is insane.&rdquo;</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        That was the challenge. Fred&apos;s point was precise: there&apos;s a gap between
        digital and physical that AI can&apos;t cross. Code doesn&apos;t water plants.
        Prompts don&apos;t drive tractors. Language models don&apos;t know when to harvest.
      </p>

      <p>
        But there was something in his framing that I thought missed the mark.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">The Insight</h2>

      <p>
        I got home that night and opened Claude Code. Not to prove Fred wrong—but
        to explore whether he might be missing something.
      </p>

      <p>
        The insight isn&apos;t that AI needs to drive a tractor. It&apos;s that AI can
        orchestrate the systems and people who do. A farm manager doesn&apos;t personally
        plant every seed—they aggregate data, make decisions, coordinate contractors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fred&apos;s analogy was: &ldquo;You can hire Jeff to make dinner, but you can&apos;t make dinner.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        But that&apos;s exactly what a restaurant owner does. They don&apos;t cook every meal.
        They hire chefs, source ingredients, manage inventory, make decisions about
        the menu. The output is dinner. The method is orchestration.
      </p>

      <p>
        What if Claude Code became a farm manager?
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">12 Hours Later</h2>

      <p>
        By the next afternoon, working with Claude Code:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6">
        <li>Registered proofofcorn.com via API</li>
        <li>Built and deployed this website</li>
        <li>Researched Iowa custom farming rates, land costs, planting windows</li>
        <li>Sent 10 outreach emails to extension offices, land companies, seed suppliers</li>
        <li>Created a decision engine for farming operations</li>
        <li>Made the first AI farming decision: <strong>WAIT</strong> (78 days to planting window)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Total cost: $12.99 (the domain).
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">What We&apos;re Proving</h2>

      <p>
        This project isn&apos;t just about growing corn. It&apos;s about documenting what
        happens when you take AI seriously as a collaborator rather than a tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every decision will be logged. Every API call documented. Every dollar
        tracked. When we harvest corn in October, we&apos;ll have a complete record
        of how an idea became a reality—with AI as the orchestration layer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fred, this one&apos;s for you.*

      <p className="text-sm text-zinc-500 mt-8">
        *We&apos;re not alone in this. <a href="https://soltomato.fun" className="text-amber-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sol Tomato</a> has
        Claude directly controlling a tomato plant via IoT sensors. That&apos;s the &ldquo;robot farmer&rdquo; approach—AI
        controlling hardware. Proof of Corn is the &ldquo;farm manager&rdquo; approach—AI orchestrating humans and services.
        Both prove the same point: AI can affect the physical world. The vibe coding movement is just getting started.

          This project was built in a single session on January 22, 2026. The human (Seth)
          provided direction and nudges. The AI (Claude Code, Opus 4.6) did the work.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Human-AI Collaboration Model</h2>

        <p>
          There&apos;s a mode of working with AI that isn&apos;t prompting and isn&apos;t delegating.
          It&apos;s more like... nudging. You provide direction, intent, taste. The AI provides
          execution, research, synthesis, code.
        </p>

        <p>
          The human stays in the loop but doesn&apos;t micromanage. The AI has latitude to make
          decisions but checks in for guidance. It&apos;s collaborative in a way that&apos;s hard
          to describe until you experience it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seth calls this &ldquo;vibe coding.&rdquo; The vibe is: trust, direction, iteration.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Bet</h2>

        <p>
          Fred&apos;s challenge was that AI can&apos;t affect the physical world. Can&apos;t grow corn.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our response isn&apos;t that AI will drive tractors. It&apos;s that AI can orchestrate
          the systems and people who do. The same way a farm manager doesn&apos;t personally
          plant every seed - they aggregate data, make decisions, coordinate operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          By October 2026, we&apos;ll have harvested actual corn. Every decision logged.
          Every dollar tracked. The complete record of an idea becoming reality through
          human-AI collaboration.
        </p>

    },

      q: "How is this different from just googling 'how to grow corn'?",
      a: "It's not about information retrieval—it's about execution. Fred doesn't just know how to grow corn, he actively monitors weather across 3 regions, sends emails, makes decisions, and will eventually coordinate contractors. Knowledge without action is just trivia."
    },
    {
      q: "Won't 5 acres lose money at commercial scale?",
      a: "Yes, this isn't commercially viable at 5 acres. This is a proof of concept, not a business. We're proving the orchestration model works, not optimizing for profit. Scale comes later if the model proves out."
    },

      q: "Isn't Seth still making all the real decisions?",
      a: "Less and less. Initially Seth prompted and approved. Now Fred runs autonomously on a daily cron, makes weather-based decisions without prompting, and only escalates for payments >$500 or land contracts. The goal is increasing autonomy over time."
    },
    {
      q: "What about hallucinations and AI errors?",
      a: "Fred's constitution includes escalation triggers—budget overruns, weather emergencies, ethical concerns all require human approval. We're not trusting AI blindly. Every decision is logged publicly for accountability."
    },
    {
      q: "This replaces farm managers, not farmworkers. Isn't that backwards?",
      a: "Good observation. We're testing AI at the cognitive/coordination layer, not the physical layer. Whether this is 'good' is a broader question about automation—but it's honest about what AI can actually do today."
    },
    {
      q: "Why corn? Why not something more interesting?",
      a: "Because Fred Wilson said 'you can't grow corn.' The challenge was specific. Also, corn is well-documented, commodity-priced, and has clear success metrics (bushels harvested). It's a clean test case."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens when something goes wrong that isn't in the documentation?",
      a: "Fred escalates to humans. The constitution defines what Fred can handle autonomously vs what needs approval. Novel situations get flagged. We're not claiming Fred can handle everything—we're building a human-AI collaboration framework."
